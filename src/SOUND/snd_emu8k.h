/*
 * From the Soundfount 2.0 fileformat Spec.:
 * 
    An envelope generates a control signal in six phases.
    When key-on occurs, a delay period begins during which the envelope value is zero.
    The envelope then rises in a convex curve to a value of one during the attack phase.
    " Note that the attack is convex; the curve is nominally such that when applied to a
    decibel or semitone parameter, the result is linear in amplitude or Hz respectively"

    When a value of one is reached, the envelope enters a hold phase during which it remains at one.
    When the hold phase ends, the envelope enters a decay phase during which its value decreases linearly to a sustain level.
    " For the Volume Envelope, the decay phase linearly ramps toward the sustain level, causing a constant dB change for each time unit. "
    When the sustain level is reached, the envelope enters sustain phase, during which the envelope stays at the sustain level. 
    
    Whenever a key-off occurs, the envelope immediately enters a release phase during which the value linearly ramps from the current value to zero.
    " For the Volume Envelope, the release phase linearly ramps toward zero from the current level, causing a constant dB change for each time unit"

    When zero is reached, the envelope value remains at zero.
    
    Modulation of pitch and filter cutoff are in octaves, semitones, and cents.
    These parameters can be modulated to varying degree, either positively or negatively, by the modulation envelope.
    The degree of modulation is specified in cents for the full-scale attack peak.
    
    The volume envelope operates in dB, with the attack peak providing a full scale output, appropriately scaled by the initial volume.
    The zero value, however, is actually zero gain.
    The implementation in the EMU8000 provides for 96 dB of amplitude control.
    When 96 dB of attenuation is reached in the final gain amplifier, an abrupt jump to zero gain (infinite dB of attenuation) occurs. In a 16-bit system, this jump is inaudible
*/
/* It seems that the envelopes don't really have a decay/release stage,
   but instead they have a volume ramper that can be triggered 
   automatically (after hold period), or manually (by activating release)
   and the "sustain" value is the target of any of both cases.
   Some programs like cubic player and AWEAmp use this, and it was
   described in the following way in Vince Vu/Judge Dredd's awe32p10.txt:
      If the MSB (most significant bit or bit 15) of this register is set,
      the Decay/Release will begin immediately, overriding the Delay, Attack,
      and Hold.  Otherwise the Decay/Release will wait until the Delay, Attack,
      and Hold are finished.  If you set the MSB of this register, you can use
      it as a volume ramper, as on the GUS.  The upper byte (except the MSB),
      contains the destination volume, and the lower byte contains the ramp time. */

/* attack_amount is linear amplitude (added directly to value). ramp_amount_db is linear dB (added directly to value too, but needs conversion to get linear amplitude).
   value range is 21bits for both, linear amplitude being 1<<21 = 0dBFS and 0 = -96dBFS (which is shortcut to silence), and db amplutide being 0 = 0dBFS and -(1<<21) = -96dBFS (which is shortcut to silence). This allows to operate db values by simply adding them. */
