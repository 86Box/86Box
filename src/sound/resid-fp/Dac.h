/**
 * Estimate DAC nonlinearity.
 * The SID DACs are built up as R-2R ladder as follows:
 *
 *         n  n-1      2   1   0    VGND
 *         |   |       |   |   |      |   Termination
 *        2R  2R      2R  2R  2R     2R   only for
 *         |   |       |   |   |      |   MOS 8580
 *     Vo -o-R-o-R-...-o-R-o-R--    --+
 *
 *
 * All MOS 6581 DACs are missing a termination resistor at bit 0. This causes
 * pronounced errors for the lower 4 - 5 bits (e.g. the output for bit 0 is
 * actually equal to the output for bit 1), resulting in DAC discontinuities
 * for the lower bits.
 * In addition to this, the 6581 DACs exhibit further severe discontinuities
 * for higher bits, which may be explained by a less than perfect match between
 * the R and 2R resistors, or by output impedance in the NMOS transistors
 * providing the bit voltages. A good approximation of the actual DAC output is
 * achieved for 2R/R ~ 2.20.
 *
 * The MOS 8580 DACs, on the other hand, do not exhibit any discontinuities.
 * These DACs include the correct termination resistor, and also seem to have
 * very accurately matched R and 2R resistors (2R/R = 2.00).
 *
 * On the 6581 the output of the waveform and envelope DACs go through
 * a voltage follower built with two NMOS:
 *
 *             Vdd
 *
 *              |
 *            |-+
 * Vin -------|    T1 (enhancement-mode)
 *            |-+
 *              |
 *              o-------- Vout
 *              |
 *            |-+
 *        +---|    T2 (depletion-mode)
 *        |   |-+
 *        |     |
