/**
 * Combined waveform calculator for WaveformGenerator.
 * By combining waveforms, the bits of each waveform are effectively short
 * circuited, a zero bit in one waveform will result in a zero output bit,
 * thus the claim that the waveforms are AND'ed.
 * However, a zero bit in one waveform may also affect the neighboring bits
 * in the output.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *                 1 1
 *     Bit #       1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
 *                 -----------------------
 *     Sawtooth    0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
 *
 *     Triangle    0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
 *
 *     AND         0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
 *
 *     Output      0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
 *
 *
 * Re-vectorized die photographs reveal the mechanism behind this behavior.
 * Each waveform selector bit acts as a switch, which directly connects
 * internal outputs into the waveform DAC inputs as follows:
 *
 * - Noise outputs the shift register bits to DAC inputs as described above.
 *   Each output is also used as input to the next bit when the shift register
 *   is shifted. Lower four bits are grounded.
 * - Pulse connects a single line to all DAC inputs. The line is connected to
 *   either 5V (pulse on) or 0V (pulse off) at bit 11, and ends at bit 0.
 * - Triangle connects the upper 11 bits of the (MSB EOR'ed) accumulator to the
 *   DAC inputs, so that DAC bit 0 = 0, DAC bit n = accumulator bit n - 1.
 * - Sawtooth connects the upper 12 bits of the accumulator to the DAC inputs,
 *   so that DAC bit n = accumulator bit n. Sawtooth blocks out the MSB from
 *   the EOR used to generate the triangle waveform.
 *
 * We can thus draw the following conclusions:
 *
 * - The shift register may be written to by combined waveforms.
 * - The pulse waveform interconnects all bits in combined waveforms via the
 *   pulse line.
 * - The combination of triangle and sawtooth interconnects neighboring bits
 *   of the sawtooth waveform.
 *
 * Also in the 6581 the MSB of the oscillator, used as input for the
 * triangle xor logic and the pulse adder's last bit, is connected directly
 * to the waveform selector, while in the 8580 it is latched at sid_clk2
 * before being forwarded to the selector. Thus in the 6581 if the sawtooth MSB
 * is pulled down it might affect the oscillator's adder
 * driving the top bit low.
