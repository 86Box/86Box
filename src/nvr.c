/*
 * 86Box	A hypervisor and IBM PC system emulator that specializes in
 *		running old operating systems and software designed for IBM
 *		PC systems and compatibles from 1981 through fairly recent
 *		system designs based on the PCI bus.
 *
 *		This file is part of the 86Box distribution.
 *
 *		Implement a more-or-less defacto-standard RTC/NVRAM.
 *
 *		When IBM released the PC/AT machine, it came standard with a
 *		battery-backed RTC chip to keep the time of day, something
 *		that was optional on standard PC's with a myriad variants
 *		being put on the market, often on cheap multi-I/O cards.
 *
 *		The PC/AT had an on-board DS12885-series chip ("the black
 *		block") which was an RTC/clock chip with onboard oscillator
 *		and a backup battery (hence the big size.) The chip also had
 *		a smal amount of RAM bytes available to the user, which was
 *		used by IBM's ROM BIOS to store machine configuration data.
 *
 *		Since then, pretty much any PC has an implementation of that
 *		device, which became known as the "nvr" or "cmos".
 *
 * NOTES	Info extracted from the data sheets:
 *
 *		* The century register at location 32h is a BCD register
 *		  designed to automatically load the BCD value 20 as the
 *		  year register changes from 99 to 00.  The MSB of this
 *		  register is not affected when the load of 20 occurs,
 *		  and remains at the value written by the user.
 *
 *		* Rate Selector (RS3:RS0)
 *		  These four rate-selection bits select one of the 13
 *		  taps on the 15-stage divider or disable the divider
 *		  output.  The tap selected can be used to generate an
 *		  output square wave (SQW pin) and/or a periodic interrupt.
 *
 *		  The user can do one of the following:
 *		   - enable the interrupt with the PIE bit;
 *		   - enable the SQW output pin with the SQWE bit;
 *		   - enable both at the same time and the same rate; or
 *		   - enable neither.
 *
 *		  Table 3 lists the periodic interrupt rates and the square
 *		  wave frequencies that can be chosen with the RS bits.
 *		  These four read/write bits are not affected by !RESET.
 *
 *		* Oscillator (DV2:DV0)
 *		  These three bits are used to turn the oscillator on or
 *		  off and to reset the countdown chain.  A pattern of 010
 *		  is the only combination of bits that turn the oscillator
 *		  on and allow the RTC to keep time.  A pattern of 11x
 *		  enables the oscillator but holds the countdown chain in
 *		  reset.  The next update occurs at 500ms after a pattern
 *		  of 010 is written to DV0, DV1, and DV2.
 *
 *		* Update-In-Progress (UIP)
 *		  This bit is a status flag that can be monitored. When the
 *		  UIP bit is a 1, the update transfer occurs soon.  When
 *		  UIP is a 0, the update transfer does not occur for at
 *		  least 244us.  The time, calendar, and alarm information
 *		  in RAM is fully available for access when the UIP bit
 *		  is 0.  The UIP bit is read-only and is not affected by
 *		  !RESET.  Writing the SET bit in Register B to a 1
 *		  inhibits any update transfer and clears the UIP status bit.
 *
 *		* Daylight Saving Enable (DSE)
 *		  This bit is a read/write bit that enables two daylight
 *		  saving adjustments when DSE is set to 1.  On the first
 *		  Sunday in April (or the last Sunday in April in the
 *		  MC146818A), the time increments from 1:59:59 AM to
 *		  3:00:00 AM.  On the last Sunday in October when the time
 *		  first reaches 1:59:59 AM, it changes to 1:00:00 AM.
 *
 *		  When DSE is enabled, the internal logic test for the
 *		  first/last Sunday condition at midnight.  If the DSE bit
 *		  is not set when the test occurs, the daylight saving
 *		  function does not operate correctly.  These adjustments
 *		  do not occur when the DSE bit is 0. This bit is not
 *		  affected by internal functions or !RESET.
 *
 *		* 24/12
 *		  The 24/12 control bit establishes the format of the hours
 *		  byte. A 1 indicates the 24-hour mode and a 0 indicates
 *		  the 12-hour mode.  This bit is read/write and is not
 *		  affected by internal functions or !RESET.
 *
 *		* Data Mode (DM)
 *		  This bit indicates whether time and calendar information
 *		  is in binary or BCD format.  The DM bit is set by the
 *		  program to the appropriate format and can be read as
 *		  required.  This bit is not modified by internal functions
 *		  or !RESET. A 1 in DM signifies binary data, while a 0 in
 *		  DM specifies BCD data.
 *
 *		* Square-Wave Enable (SQWE)
 *		  When this bit is set to 1, a square-wave signal at the
 *		  frequency set by the rate-selection bits RS3-RS0 is driven
 *		  out on the SQW pin.  When the SQWE bit is set to 0, the
 *		  SQW pin is held low. SQWE is a read/write bit and is
 *		  cleared by !RESET.  SQWE is low if disabled, and is high
 *		  impedance when VCC is below VPF. SQWE is cleared to 0 on
 *		  !RESET.
 *
 *		* Update-Ended Interrupt Enable (UIE)
 *		  This bit is a read/write bit that enables the update-end
 *		  flag (UF) bit in Register C to assert !IRQ.  The !RESET
 *		  pin going low or the SET bit going high clears the UIE bit.
 *		  The internal functions of the device do not affect the UIE
 *		  bit, but is cleared to 0 on !RESET.
 *
 *		* Alarm Interrupt Enable (AIE)
 *		  This bit is a read/write bit that, when set to 1, permits
 *		  the alarm flag (AF) bit in Register C to assert !IRQ.  An
 *		  alarm interrupt occurs for each second that the three time
 *		  bytes equal the three alarm bytes, including a don't-care
 *		  alarm code of binary 11XXXXXX.  The AF bit does not
 *		  initiate the !IRQ signal when the AIE bit is set to 0.
 *		  The internal functions of the device do not affect the AIE
 *		  bit, but is cleared to 0 on !RESET.
 *
 *		* Periodic Interrupt Enable (PIE)
 *		  The PIE bit is a read/write bit that allows the periodic
 *		  interrupt flag (PF) bit in Register C to drive the !IRQ pin
 *		  low.  When the PIE bit is set to 1, periodic interrupts are
 *		  generated by driving the !IRQ pin low at a rate specified
 *		  by the RS3-RS0 bits of Register A.  A 0 in the PIE bit
 *		  blocks the !IRQ output from being driven by a periodic
 *		  interrupt, but the PF bit is still set at the periodic
 *		  rate.  PIE is not modified b any internal device functions,
 *		  but is cleared to 0 on !RESET.
 *
 *		* SET
 *		  When the SET bit is 0, the update transfer functions
 *		  normally by advancing the counts once per second.  When
 *		  the SET bit is written to 1, any update transfer is
 *		  inhibited, and the program can initialize the time and
 *		  calendar bytes without an update occurring in the midst of
 *		  initializing. Read cycles can be executed in a similar
 *		  manner. SET is a read/write bit and is not affected by
 *		  !RESET or internal functions of the device.
 *
 *		* Update-Ended Interrupt Flag (UF)
 *		  This bit is set after each update cycle. When the UIE
 *		  bit is set to 1, the 1 in UF causes the IRQF bit to be
 *		  a 1, which asserts the !IRQ pin.  This bit can be
 *		  cleared by reading Register C or with a !RESET. 
 *
 *		* Alarm Interrupt Flag (AF)
 *		  A 1 in the AF bit indicates that the current time has
 *		  matched the alarm time.  If the AIE bit is also 1, the
 *		  !IRQ pin goes low and a 1 appears in the IRQF bit. This
 *		  bit can be cleared by reading Register C or with a
 *		  !RESET.
 *
 *		* Periodic Interrupt Flag (PF)
 *		  This bit is read-only and is set to 1 when an edge is
 *		  detected on the selected tap of the divider chain.  The
 *		  RS3 through RS0 bits establish the periodic rate. PF is
 *		  set to 1 independent of the state of the PIE bit.  When
 *		  both PF and PIE are 1s, the !IRQ signal is active and
 *		  sets the IRQF bit. This bit can be cleared by reading
 *		  Register C or with a !RESET.
 *
 *		* Interrupt Request Flag (IRQF)
 *		  The interrupt request flag (IRQF) is set to a 1 when one
 *		  or more of the following are true:
 *		   - PF == PIE == 1
 *		   - AF == AIE == 1
 *		   - UF == UIE == 1
 *		  Any time the IRQF bit is a 1, the !IRQ pin is driven low.
 *		  All flag bits are cleared after Register C is read by the
 *		  program or when the !RESET pin is low.
 *
 *		* Valid RAM and Time (VRT)
 *		  This bit indicates the condition of the battery connected
 *		  to the VBAT pin. This bit is not writeable and should
 *		  always be 1 when read.  If a 0 is ever present, an
 *		  exhausted internal lithium energy source is indicated and
 *		  both the contents of the RTC data and RAM data are
 *		  questionable.  This bit is unaffected by !RESET.
 *
 *		This file implements an internal RTC clock, plus a generic
 *		version of the RTC/NVRAM chip, including the later update
 *		(DS12887A) which implemented a "century" register to be 
 *		compatible with Y2K.
