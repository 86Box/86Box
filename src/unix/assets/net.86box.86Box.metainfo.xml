            86Box is a hypervisor and IBM PC system emulator that specializes
            in running old operating systems and software designed for IBM
            PC systems and compatibles from 1981 through fairly recent
            system designs based on the PCI bus.

            It supports various models of PCs, graphics and sound
            cards, and CPUs.

            To use 86Box you will need to dump BIOS ROMs for each machine you
            want to emulate.
