/*
 * VARCem	Virtual ARchaeological Computer EMulator.
 *		An emulator of (mostly) x86-based PC systems and devices,
 *		using the ISA,EISA,VLB,MCA  and PCI system buses, roughly
 *		spanning the era between 1981 and 1995.
 *
 *		This file is part of the VARCem Project.
 *
 *		Implementation of the DTK PII-151B and PII-158B cards.
 *
 *		These are DP8473-based floppy controller ISA cards for XT
 *		class systems, and allow usage of standard and high-density
 *		drives on them. They have their own BIOS which takes over
 *		from the standard system BIOS.
