 * VARCem	Virtual ARchaeological Computer EMulator.
 *		An emulator of (mostly) x86-based PC systems and devices,
 *		using the ISA,EISA,VLB,MCA  and PCI system buses, roughly
 *		spanning the era between 1981 and 1995.
 *
 *		This file is part of the VARCem Project.
 *
 *		Definitions for the generic NVRAM/CMOS driver.
