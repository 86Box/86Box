			LICENSE

COPYING by default refers to the GNU Project's GPL v2

that is compatible this one, feel free to do so. An example
of a copyright notice with a different licensing statement
would be like the following:

	/* Copyright holders: Edward Doe
	   uses the MIT expat license. see
	   https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
	   for more details
	*/

Your license does not have to be this one nor it does not
have to be a URL link. It can be contained in a seperate
file for convenience and direct access.
