## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, either open an issue here on GitHub or join our Discord server. If it is
accepted, that means we have begun working on it and it will be fixed if it is at all possible. If it
is declined, then that means we have either determined it to not actually be a vulnerability or we
have determined it is not feasible to fix it. On GitHub, we are going to notify you when a decision
taken, and if accepted, when it is fixed. On Discord, you get live updates.
