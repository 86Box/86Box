# Code of Conduct
In order for everyone to enjoy their time contributing to 86Box or otherwise being a part of the community, we kindly ask you to review and follow the below rules.

## 1. No illegal activity or GitHub ToS violations
- 1.1. Do not distribute malware for non-research purposes. Post samples in a clearly named encrypted archive.
- 1.2. Posting old software is allowed if at least 10 years old and out of support.
- 1.3. Do not post NSFW content (defined at the staff's discretion).
- 1.4. Do not do anything forbidden by the law or the Discord or GitHub Terms of Service.

## 2. No offensive or disruptive behavior or harassment
- 2.1. No gate-keeping. We aim to accommodate and welcome people of all different opinions and knowledge levels to this community.
- 2.2. You may speak any language but provide a summary in English so that we can understand what you are saying and use English when requested.
- 2.3. Do not retroactively delete messages or do major edits unless you posted something by mistake.
- 2.4. Do not antagonize, defame, demean, blackmail, impersonate, dox others, bring outside drama, use intentionally offensive profile aspects, or otherwise post messages to start a fight (eg. platform wars). Discuss or debate the idea, not the person.
- 2.5. Do not backseat moderate, spam, flood, unsolicitedly ping people, advertise without permission, or evade blocks.
- 2.6. Do not speak on behalf of the project unless you are a team member. This includes all messages which could reasonably be understood as being an official position. Ask a team member if you're unsure about your message.
- 2.7. Decisions by higher-ranked users supersede those by lower-ranked users. This applies to moderation **and** emulator development. Rank and seniority must be earned.
- 2.8. Do not engage in political discussions.
- 2.9. Ignoring essential communication from team members does not exempt you from possible actions against you. Seniority must be earned.

## 3. Moderation and appeal protocol
- 3.1. Rule violations are punished at the team's discretion, taking all circumstances into account.
- 3.2. Rules enforcement must be equal, impartial, and not retroactive or politically motivated.
- 3.3. Everyone is innocent until proven guilty.
- 3.4. Unless there is an emergency, urgent action is otherwise warranted, or a user is participating with the express purpose of violating our rules, the team shall deliberate before taking action in order to reach consensus and avoid team conflicts.

## 4. Do not insist on requests or suggestions
- 4.1. You may politely request something from us; if rejected, you are going to be told why and what to do to have it reconsidered.
- 4.2. Follow the contribution requirements listed on the GitHub readme.
- 4.3. Follow proper procedure (eg. for pull requests or bug reports).
