Performance may vary depending on both host and guest configuration. Most emulation logic is executed in a single thread, therefore generally systems with better IPC (instructions per clock) should be able to emulate higher clock speeds.

It is also recommended to use a manager application with 86Box for easier handling of multiple virtual machines.

  * The new manager with improved new user experience; installer, automatic updates of emulator files and more.
* [86Box Manager](https://github.com/86Box/86BoxManager) by [daviunic](https://github.com/daviunic) (Overdoze)
  * The traditional 86Box manager with simple interface.

However, it is also possible to use 86Box on its own with the `--vmpath`/`-P` command line option.
